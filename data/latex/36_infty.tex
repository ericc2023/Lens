function is $F_{Y_{\mathrm{t}}|D=d,M=m}^{-1}(q)=\displaystyle \inf\{y\ :\ F_{Y_{\mathrm{t}}|D=d,M=m}(y)\ \geq q\}$. Furthermore,

$Q_{dm}(y) :=F_{Y_{1}|D=d,M=m}^{-1}$ ? $F_{Y_{0}|D=d,M=m}(y)=F_{Y_{1}|D=d,M=m}^{-1}(F_{Y_{0}|D=d,M=m}(y))$

is the quantile-quantile transform of the conditional outcome from period $0$ to 1

given treatment $d$ and mediator status $m$. This transform maps $y$ at rank $q$ in

period $0 (q\ =\ F_{Y_{0}|D=d,M=m}(y))$ into the corresponding $y'$ at rank $q$ in period 1

$(y'=F_{Y_{1}|D=d,M=m}^{-1}(q))$ .

1 Identification and Estimation

1.1 Identification

This sections discusses the identifying assumptions along with the identification

results for the various direct and indirect effects. We note that our assumptions

could be adjusted to only hold conditional on a vector of observed covariates. In

this case, the identification results would hold within cells defined upon covari-

ate values. In our main discussion, however, covariates are not considered for the

sake of ease of notation. For notational convenience, we maintain throughout that

$\mathrm{P}\mathrm{r} (T\ =\ t,\ D\ =\ d,\ M\ =\ m) > 0$ for $t, d, m \in \{1,\ 0\}$, implying that all possible

treatment-mediator combinations exist in the population in both time periods. Our

first assumption implies that potential outcomes are characterized by a continuous

nonparametric function, denoted by $h$, that is strictly monotonic in a scalar $U$ that

reflects unobserved heterogeneity.

Assumption 1: Strict monotonicity of continuous potential outcomes in unob-

served heterogeneity.

The potential outcomes satisfy the following model: $Y_{t}(d,\ m) = h(d,\ m,\ t,\ U)$ , with

the general function $h$ being continuous and strictly increasing in the scalar unob-

servable $U\in \mathbb{R}$ for all $d, m, t\in\{0$, 1$\}.$

Assumption 1 requires the potential outcomes to be continuous implying that there
